# Create Branch Backend

## Usefull information: 
* As currently implemented, the backend application deletes the content in the database, and creates the database model from scratch. Be aware of this when restarting the application.
* Follows the MVC pattern - (model, view, controller)
* Uses websockets for event-pushing from backend to frontend
